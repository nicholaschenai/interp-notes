# Description of result
this understands features then work backwards to create an artificial ANN to implement features, then compare that against the naturally trained NN and show that properties are similar.

---
# How it compares to previous work
foo

---
# Main strategies used to obtain results
- "We manually set the weights of a blank neural network to implement the neuron families and circuit motifs from this article, crafting an _artificial_ artificial neural network,"

---

## Interesting points
"negative weights are used for things that are in some way similar enough that they could be mistaken. This seems potentially analogous to lateral inhibition in biological neural networks."


## Misc
- colab seems to require access?
